"""
In this process, we consider the following operations to be fast:

- Get degree of node
- Get downstream targets of node
- Get attributes on a node

These operations are medium:

- Get upstream sources of node
- Get degrees of all nodes in host graph
- Get nodes with a certain attribute

These operations are slow:
- Get edges where nodes have a certain attribute
    - But you can do the same with get-downstream-targets and filter an
      attribute search.
